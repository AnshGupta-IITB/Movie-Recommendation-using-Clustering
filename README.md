# Movie-Recommendation-using-Clustering
This project uses clustering algorithms, like K-Means or hierarchical clustering, to group movies based on features such as genre, user ratings, and metadata. By clustering similar movies together, the system recommends films to users based on the cluster of movies they have previously liked or rated highly.

The dataset **Movielens 100k** is taken from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k
